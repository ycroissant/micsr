I outline a general class of hazard models for grouped duration data based upon the choice of period-specific distribution functions, facilitating a thorough analysis of the implications of various specifications and consideration of various issues of model identification. This class of models nests, among others, the proportional hazard, probit, and logit specifications for interval survival. I consider the implications of various specifications for hazard behaviour, focusing on familiar specifications. While the specifications will generally yield results that are quite similar along a number of dimensions, there are significant differences. The probit model generates non-proportional effects of variables on the discrete hazard, while the logit and PH tend to show only slight non-proportionality. Furthermore, while the effects of variables on the derivatives are considerably larger for the probit specification, the time-pattern of the probit effects is relatively insensitive to changes in explanatory variables. I illustrate these issues by providing an example taken from Katz's (1986) unemployment data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.},

                  the ridership share on a proposed new (or improved)
                  intercity travel service and to identify the modes
                  from which existing intercity travelers will be
                  diverted to the new or upgraded service constitutes
                  a critical part of evaluating alternative travel
                  service proposals to alleviate intercity travel
                  congestion. This paper develops a new
                  heteroscedastic extreme value model of intercity
                  mode choice that overcomes the ‚Äòindependence of
                  irrelevant alternatives‚Äô (IIA) property of the
                  commonly used multinomial logit model. The proposed
                  model allows a more flexible cross-elasticity
                  structure among alternatives than the nested logit
                  model. It is also simple, intuitive and much less of
                  a computational burden than the multinomial probit
                  model. The paper discusses the non-IIA property of
                  the heteroscedastic extreme value model and presents
                  an efficient and accurate Gaussian quadrature
                  technique to estimate the heteroscedastic model
                  using the maximum likelihood method. The multinomial
                  logit, alternative nested logit structures, and the
                  heteroscedastic model are estimated to examine the
                  impact of improved rail service on business travel
                  in the Toronto-Montreal corridor. The nested logit
                  structures are either inconsistent with utility
                  maximization principles or are not significantly
                  better than the multinomial logit model. The
                  heteroscedastic extreme value model, however, is
                  found to be superior to the multinomial logit
                  model. The heteroscedastic model predicts smaller
                  increases in rail shares and smaller decreases in
                  non-rail shares than the multinomial logit in
                  response to rail-service improvements. It also
                  suggests a larger percentage decrease in air share
                  and a smaller percentage decrease in auto share than
                  the multinomial logit. Thus, the multinomial logit
                  model is likely to provide overly optimistic
                  projections of rail ridership and revenue, and of
                  alleviation in inter-city travel congestion in
                  general, and highway traffic congestion in
                  particular. These findings point to the limitations
                  of the multinomial logit and nested logit models in
                  studying intercity mode choice behavior and to the
                  usefulness of the heteroscedastic model proposed in
                  this paper."

                  of the multinomial logit (MNL) model imposes the
                  restriction of zero covariance between the utilities
                  of pairs of alternatives. This restriction is
                  inappropriate for many choice situations; those in
                  which some pairs or sets of alternatives share the
                  same unobserved attributes. The nested logit (NL)
                  model relaxes the zero covariance restriction of the
                  MNL model but imposes the restriction of equal
                  covariance among all alternatives in a common nest
                  and zero covariance otherwise. The paired
                  combinatorial logit (PCL) model relaxes these
                  restrictions further by allowing different
                  covariances for each pair of alternatives. This
                  relaxation enables the estimation of differential
                  competitive relationships between each pair of
                  alternatives. The closed form of the PCL model
                  retains the computational advantages of other logit
                  models while the more flexible error correlation
                  structure, compared to the MNL model and NL models,
                  enables better representation of many choice
                  situations. This paper describes the derivation,
                  structure, properties and estimation of the PCL
                  model. The empirical results demonstrate that the
                  PCL model is statistically superior to the MNL and
                  NL models and may lead to importantly different
                  travel forecasts and policy decisions."

                  previously developed generalized extreme value (GEV)

                  (CNL) models as special cases. It also includes the

                  the fractional allocation of each alternative to a
                  set of nests, each of which has a distinct logsum or
                  dissimilarity parameter. An empirical example of
                  intercity mode choice confirms the statistical
                  superiority of the GNL model to the paired
                  combinatorial logit, cross-nested logit and nested
                  logit models and indicates important differences in
                  cross-elasticity relationships across pairs of
                  alternatives."
